# lru-cache

A cache object that deletes the least-recently-used items.

Specify a max number of the most recently used items that you
want to keep, and this cache will keep that many of the most
recently accessed items.

This is not primarily a TTL cache, and does not make strong TTL
guarantees. There is no preemptive pruning of expired items by
default, but you _may_ set a TTL on the cache or on a single
`set`. If you do so, it will treat expired items as missing, and
delete them when fetched. If you are more interested in TTL
caching than LRU caching, check out
[@isaacs/ttlcache](http://npm.im/@isaacs/ttlcache).

As of version 7, this is one of the most performant LRU
implementations available in JavaScript, and supports a wide
diversity of use cases. However, note that using some of the
features will necessarily impact performance, by causing the
cache to have to do more work. See the "Performance" section
below.

## Installation

```bash
npm install lru-cache --save
```

## Usage

```js
// hybrid module, either works
import LRUCache from 'lru-cache'
// or:
const LRUCache = require('lru-cache')

// At least one of 'max', 'ttl', or 'maxSize' is required, to prevent
// unsafe unbounded storage.
//
// In most cases, it's best to specify a max for performance, so all
// the required memory allocation is done up-front.
//
// All the other options are optional, see the sections below for
// documentation on what each one does.  Most of them can be
// overridden for specific items in get()/set()
const options = {
  max: 500,

  // for use with tracking overall storage size
  maxSize: 5000,
  sizeCalculation: (value, key) => {
    return 1
  },

  // for use when you need to clean up something when objects
  // are evicted from the cache
  dispose: (value, key) => {
    freeFromMemoryOrWhatever(value)
  },

  // how long to live in ms
  ttl: 1000 * 60 * 5,

  // return stale items before removing from cache?
  allowStale: false,

  updateAgeOnGet: false,
  updateAgeOnHas: false,

  // async method to use for cache.fetch(), for
  // stale-while-revalidate type of behavior
  fetchMethod: async (key, staleValue, { options, signal }) => {},
}

const cache = new LRUCache(options)

cache.set('key', 'value')
cache.get('key') // "value"

// non-string keys ARE fully supported
// but note that it must be THE SAME object, not
// just a JSON-equivalent object.
var someObject = { a: 1 }
cache.set(someObject, 'a value')
// Object keys are not toString()-ed
cache.set('[object Object]', 'a different value')
assert.equal(cache.get(someObject), 'a value')
// A similar object with same keys/values won't work,
// because it's a different object identity
assert.equal(cache.get({ a: 1 }), undefined)

cache.clear() // empty the cache
```

If you put more stuff in it, then items will fall out.

## Options

### `max`

The maximum number of items that remain in the cache (assuming no
TTL pruning or explicit deletions). Note that fewer items may be
stored if size calculation is used, and `maxSize` is exceeded.
This must be a positive finite intger.

At least one of `max`, `maxSize`, or `TTL` is required. This
must be a positive integer if set.

**It is strongly recommended to set a `max` to prevent unbounded
growth of the cache.** See "Storage Bounds Safety" below.

### `maxSize`

Set to a positive integer to track the sizes of items added to
the cache, and automatically evict items in order to stay below
this size. Note that this may result in fewer than `max` items
being stored.

Attempting to add an item to the cache whose calculated size is
greater that this amount will be a no-op. The item will not be
cached, and no other items will be evicted.

Optional, must be a positive integer if provided.

Sets `maxEntrySize` to the same value, unless a different value
is provided for `maxEntrySize`.

At least one of `max`, `maxSize`, or `TTL` is required. This
must be a positive integer if set.

Even if size tracking is enabled, **it is strongly recommended to
set a `max` to prevent unbounded growth of the cache.** See
"Storage Bounds Safety" below.

### `maxEntrySize`

Set to a positive integer to track the sizes of items added to
the cache, and prevent caching any item over a given size.
Attempting to add an item whose calculated size is greater than
this amount will be a no-op. The item will not be cached, and no
other items will be evicted.

Optional, must be a positive integer if provided. Defaults to
the value of `maxSize` if provided.

### `sizeCalculation`

Function used to calculate the size of stored items. If you're
storing strings or buffers, then you probably want to do
something like `n => n.length`. The item is passed as the first
argument, and the key is passed as the second argument.

This may be overridden by passing an options object to
`cache.set()`.

Requires `maxSize` to be set.

If the `size` (or return value of `sizeCalculation`) for a given
entry is greater than `maxEntrySize`, then the item will not be
added to the cache.

Deprecated alias: `length`

### `fetchMethod`

Function that is used to make background asynchronous fetches.
Called with `fetchMethod(key, staleValue, { signal, options,
context })`. May return a Promise.

If `fetchMethod` is not provided, then `cache.fetch(key)` is
equivalent to `Promise.resolve(cache.get(key))`.

The `signal` object is an `AbortSignal` if that's available in
the global object, otherwise it's a pretty close polyfill.

If at any time, `signal.aborted` is set to `true`, or if the
`signal.onabort` method is called, or if it emits an `'abort'`
event which you can listen to with `addEventListener`, then that
means that the fetch should be abandoned. This may be passed
along to async functions aware of AbortController/AbortSignal
behavior.

The `fetchMethod` should **only** return `undefined` or a Promise
resolving to `undefined` if the AbortController signaled an
`abort` event. In all other cases, it should return or resolve
to a value suitable for adding to the cache.

The `options` object is a union of the options that may be
provided to `set()` and `get()`. If they are modified, then that
will result in modifying the settings to `cache.set()` when the
value is resolved, and in the case of `noDeleteOnFetchRejection`
and `allowStaleOnFetchRejection`, the handling of `fetchMethod`
failures.

For example, a DNS cache may update the TTL based on the value
returned from a remote DNS server by changing `options.ttl` in
the `fetchMethod`.

### `fetchContext`

Arbitrary data that can be passed to the `fetchMethod` as the
`context` option.

Note that this will only be relevant when the `cache.fetch()`
call needs to call `fetchMethod()`. Thus, any data which will
meaningfully vary the fetch response needs to be present in the
key. This is primarily intended for including `x-request-id`
headers and the like for debugging purposes, which do not affect
the `fetchMethod()` response.

### `noDeleteOnFetchRejection`

If a `fetchMethod` throws an error or returns a rejected promise,
then by default, any existing stale value will be removed from
the cache.

If `noDeleteOnFetchRejection` is set to `true`, then this
behavior is suppressed, and the stale value remains in the cache
in the case of a rejected `fetchMethod`.

This is important in cases where a `fetchMethod` is _only_ called
as a background update while the stale value is returned, when
`allowStale` is used.

This is implicitly in effect when `allowStaleOnFetchRejection` is
set.

This may be set in calls to `fetch()`, or defaulted on the
constructor, or overridden by modifying the options object in the
`fetchMethod`.

### `allowStaleOnFetchRejection`

Set to true to return a stale value from the cache when a
`fetchMethod` throws an error or returns a rejected Promise.

If a `fetchMethod` fails, and there is no stale value available,
the `fetch()` will resolve to `undefined`. Ie, all `fetchMethod`
errors are suppressed.

Implies `noDeleteOnFetchRejection`.

This may be set in calls to `fetch()`, or defaulted on the
constructor, or overridden by modifying the options object in the
`fetchMethod`.

### `allowStaleOnFetchAbort`

Set to true to return a stale value from the cache when the
`AbortSignal` passed to the `fetchMethod` dispatches an `'abort'`
event, whether user-triggered, or due to internal cache behavior.

Unless `ignoreFetchAbort` is also set, the underlying
`fetchMethod` will still be considered canceled, and its return
value will be ignored and not cached.

### `ignoreFetchAbort`

Set to true to ignore the `abort` event emitted by the
`AbortSignal` object passed to `fetchMethod`, and still cache the
resulting resolution value, as long as it is not `undefined`.

When used on its own, this means aborted `fetch()` calls are not
immediately resolved or rejected when they are aborted, and
instead take the full time to await.

When used with `allowStaleOnFetchAbort`, aborted `fetch()` calls
will resolve immediately to their stale cached value or
`undefined`, and will continue to process and eventually update
the cache when they resolve, as long as the resulting value is
not `undefined`, thus supporting a "return stale on timeout while
refreshing" mechanism by passing `AbortSignal.timeout(n)` as the
signal.

For example:

```js
const c = new LRUCache({
  ttl: 100,
  ignoreFetchAbort: true,
  allowStaleOnFetchAbort: true,
  fetchMethod: async (key, oldValue, { signal }) => {
    // note: do NOT pass the signal to fetch()!
    // let's say this fetch can take a long time.
    const res = await fetch(`https://slow-backend-server/${key}`)
    return await res.json()
  },
})

// this will return the stale value after 100ms, while still
// updating in the background for next time.
const val = await c.fetch('key', { signal: AbortSignal.timeout(100) })
```

**Note**: regardless of this setting, an `abort` event _is still
emitted on the `AbortSignal` object_, so may result in invalid
results when passed to other underlying APIs that use
AbortSignals.

This may be overridden on the `fetch()` call or in the
`fetchMethod` itself.

### `dispose`

Function that is called on items when they are dropped from the
cache, as `this.dispose(value, key, reason)`.

This can be handy if you want to close file descriptors or do
other cleanup tasks when items are no longer stored in the cache.

**NOTE**: It is called _before_ the item has been fully removed
from the cache, so if you want to put it right back in, you need
to wait until the next tick. If you try to add it back in during
the `dispose()` function call, it will break things in subtle and
weird ways.

Unlike several other options, this may _not_ be overridden by
passing an option to `set()`, for performance reasons. If
disposal functions may vary between cache entries, then the
entire list must be scanned on every cache swap, even if no
disposal function is in use.

The `reason` will be one of the following strings, corresponding
to the reason for the item's deletion:

- `evict` Item was evicted to make space for a new addition
- `set` Item was overwritten by a new value
- `delete` Item was removed by explicit `cache.delete(key)` or by
  calling `cache.clear()`, which deletes everything.

The `dispose()` method is _not_ called for canceled calls to
`fetchMethod()`. If you wish to handle evictions, overwrites,
and deletes of in-flight asynchronous fetches, you must use the
`AbortSignal` provided.

Optional, must be a function.

### `disposeAfter`

The same as `dispose`, but called _after_ the entry is completely
removed and the cache is once again in a clean state.

It is safe to add an item right back into the cache at this
point. However, note that it is _very_ easy to inadvertently
create infinite recursion in this way.

The `disposeAfter()` method is _not_ called for canceled calls to
`fetchMethod()`. If you wish to handle evictions, overwrites,
and deletes of in-flight asynchronous fetches, you must use the
`AbortSignal` provided.

### `noDisposeOnSet`

Set to `true` to suppress calling the `dispose()` function if the
entry key is still accessible within the cache.

This may be overridden by passing an options object to
`cache.set()`.

Boolean, default `false`. Only relevant if `dispose` or
`disposeAfter` options are set.

### `ttl`

Max time to live for items before they are considered stale.
Note that stale items are NOT preemptively removed by default,
and MAY live in the cache, contributing to its LRU max, long
after they have expired.

Also, as this cache is optimized for LRU/MRU operations, some of
the staleness/TTL checks will reduce performance.

This is not primarily a TTL cache, and does not make strong TTL
guarantees. There is no pre-emptive pruning of expired items,
but you _may_ set a TTL on the cache, and it will treat expired
items as missing when they are fetched, and delete them.

Optional, but must be a positive integer in ms if specified.

This may be overridden by passing an options object to
`cache.set()`.

At least one of `max`, `maxSize`, or `TTL` is required. This
must be a positive integer if set.

Even if ttl tracking is enabled, **it is strongly recommended to
set a `max` to prevent unbounded growth of the cache.** See
"Storage Bounds Safety" below.

If ttl tracking is enabled, and `max` and `maxSize` are not set,
and `ttlAutopurge` is not set, then a warning will be emitted
cautioning about the potential for unbounded memory consumption.

Deprecated alias: `maxAge`

### `noUpdateTTL`

Boolean flag to tell the cache to not update the TTL when setting
a new value for an existing key (ie, when updating a value rather
than inserting a new value). Note that the TTL value is _always_
set (if provided) when adding a new entry into the cache.

This may be passed as an option to `cache.set()`.

Boolean, default false.

### `ttlResolution`

Minimum amount of time in ms in which to check for staleness.
Defaults to `1`, which means that the current time is checked at
most once per millisecond.

Set to `0` to check the current time every time staleness is
tested.

Note that setting this to a higher value _will_ improve
performance somewhat while using ttl tracking, albeit at the
expense of keeping stale items around a bit longer than intended.

### `ttlAutopurge`

Preemptively remove stale items from the cache.

Note that this may _significantly_ degrade performance,
especially if the cache is storing a large number of items. It
is almost always best to just leave the stale items in the cache,
and let them fall out as new items are added.

Note that this means that `allowStale` is a bit pointless, as
stale items will be deleted almost as soon as they expire.

Use with caution!

Boolean, default `false`

### `allowStale`

By default, if you set `ttl`, it'll only delete stale items from
the cache when you `get(key)`. That is, it's not preemptively
pruning items.

If you set `allowStale:true`, it'll return the stale value as
well as deleting it. If you don't set this, then it'll return
`undefined` when you try to get a stale entry.

Note that when a stale entry is fetched, _even if it is returned
due to `allowStale` being set_, it is removed from the cache
immediately. You can immediately put it back in the cache if you
wish, thus resetting the TTL.

This may be overridden by passing an options object to
`cache.get()`. The `cache.has()` method will always return
`false` for stale items.

Boolean, default false, only relevant if `ttl` is set.

Deprecated alias: `stale`

### `noDeleteOnStaleGet`

When using time-expiring entries with `ttl`, by default stale
items will be removed from the cache when the key is accessed
with `cache.get()`.

Setting `noDeleteOnStaleGet` to `true` will cause stale items to
remain in the cache, until they are explicitly deleted with
`cache.delete(key)`, or retrieved with `noDeleteOnStaleGet` set
to `false`.

This may be overridden by passing an options object to
`cache.get()`.

Boolean, default false, only relevant if `ttl` is set.

### `updateAgeOnGet`

When using time-expiring entries with `ttl`, setting this to
`true` will make each item's age reset to 0 whenever it is
retrieved from cache with `get()`, causing it to not expire. (It
can still fall out of cache based on recency of use, of course.)

This may be overridden by passing an options object to
`cache.get()`.

Boolean, default false, only relevant if `ttl` is set.

### `updateAgeOnHas`

When using time-expiring entries with `ttl`, setting this to
`true` will make each item's age reset to 0 whenever its presence
in the cache is checked with `has()`, causing it to not expire.
(It can still fall out of cache based on recency of use, of
course.)

This may be overridden by passing an options object to
`cache.has()`.

Boolean, default false, only relevant if `ttl` is set.

## API

### `new LRUCache(options)`

Create a new LRUCache. All options are documented above, and are
on the cache as public members.

### `cache.max`, `cache.maxSize`, `cache.allowStale`,

`cache.noDisposeOnSet`, `cache.sizeCalculation`, `cache.dispose`,
`cache.maxSize`, `cache.ttl`, `cache.updateAgeOnGet`,
`cache.updateAgeOnHas`

All option names are exposed as public members on the cache
object.

These are intended for read access only. Changing them during
program operation can cause undefined behavior.

### `cache.size`

The total number of items held in the cache at the current
moment.

### `cache.calculatedSize`

The total size of items in cache when using size tracking.

### `set(key, value, [{ size, sizeCalculation, ttl, noDisposeOnSet, start, status }])`

Add a value to the cache.

Optional options object may contain `ttl` and `sizeCalculation`
as described above, which default to the settings on the cache
object.

If `start` is provided, then that will set the effective start
time for the TTL calculation. Note that this must be a previous
value of `performance.now()` if supported, or a previous value of
`Date.now()` if not.

Options object may also include `size`, which will prevent
calling the `sizeCalculation` function and just use the specified
number if it is a positive integer, and `noDisposeOnSet` which
will prevent calling a `dispose` function in the case of
overwrites.

If the `size` (or return value of `sizeCalculation`) for a given
entry is greater than `maxEntrySize`, then the item will not be
added to the cache.

Will update the recency of the entry.

Returns the cache object.

For the usage of the `status` option, see **Status Tracking**
below.

### `get(key, { updateAgeOnGet, allowStale, status } = {}) => value`

Return a value from the cache.

Will update the recency of the cache entry found.

If the key is not found, `get()` will return `undefined`. This
can be confusing when setting values specifically to `undefined`,
as in `cache.set(key, undefined)`. Use `cache.has()` to
determine whether a key is present in the cache at all.

For the usage of the `status` option, see **Status Tracking**
below.

### `async fetch(key, options = {}) => Promise`

The following options are supported:

- `updateAgeOnGet`
- `allowStale`
- `size`
- `sizeCalculation`
- `ttl`
- `noDisposeOnSet`
- `forceRefresh`
- `status` - See **Status Tracking** below.
- `signal` - AbortSignal can be used to cancel the `fetch()`.
  Note that the `signal` option provided to the `fetchMethod` is
  a different object, because it must also respond to internal
  cache state changes, but aborting this signal will abort the
  one passed to `fetchMethod` as well.
- `fetchContext` - sets the `context` option passed to the
  underlying `fetchMethod`.

If the value is in the cache and not stale, then the returned
Promise resolves to the value.

If not in the cache, or beyond its TTL staleness, then
`fetchMethod(key, staleValue, { options, signal, context })` is
called, and the value returned will be added to the cache once
resolved.

If called with `allowStale`, and an asynchronous fetch is
currently in progress to reload a stale value, then the former
stale value will be returned.

If called with `forceRefresh`, then the cached item will be
re-fetched, even if it is not stale. However, if `allowStale` is
set, then the old value will still be returned. This is useful
in cases where you want to force a reload of a cached value. If
a background fetch is already in progress, then `forceRefresh`
has no effect.

Multiple fetches for the same `key` will only c
